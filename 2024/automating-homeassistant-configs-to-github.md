Being a newbie to Home Assistant, I wanted to automate the changes to the configuration files/folder by pushing these backups to a private GitHub repository. This approach helps avoid exposing any secrets or API tokens and ensures that I can restore contents when required due to any failures of the Home Assistant instance.

While many articles cover this topic, I want to capture all the steps comprehensively without neglecting any detail. Here is a step-by-step guide to setting up this automation: 

1. Install Advanced SSH & Web Terminal Addon. [Home Assistant Community Add-on: Advanced SSH & Web Terminal](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-ssh)

2. Create the .gitignore file in the terminal by using the following command. Include the needed lines of code in the .gitignore for excluding it from committing. 
```zsh
nano .gitignore 
```

3. Initial git commands and changing master to main branch for keeping the GitHub naming convention for branches. 
```sh
git init
# add all files to repository by using .
git add .
# By default the HA terminal will create master branch which can be updated to main with the following command. type git branch -m master main
➜  /config git:(master) ✗ git branch -m master main
# now branch is updated commond line will display follows
➜  /config git:(main) ✗
```

4. Create .ssh directory to store SSH key passphrases. **[More reading](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/about-ssh)**

```sh
# create a directory named as .ssh by using mkdir command
➜ mkdir .ssh          
# enter the following line of command ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C “myemail@gmail.com” 
➜ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C “akbarsaitn.cfmx@gmail.com”  
# Enter the file name as .ssh/id_rsa to save the key and enter twice for creating empty password. It will display the following confirmations. 
Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa): .ssh/id_rsa
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in .ssh/id_rsa
Your public key has been saved in .ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

5. Copy and add the SSH key generated from file "ssh/id_rsa.pub" to the "SSH and GPG Key" section in the github.com. [https://github.com/settings/ssh/new](https://github.com/settings/ssh/new)

6. Enter the following command to target and inform where the newly generated id_rsa file.
```zsh
➜  git config core.sshCommand "ssh -i /config/.ssh/id_rsa -F /dev/null"
```

7. Now enter the following commands. You will obtain these lines of code when the creating your free GitHub repository. **Remember** to use **SSH** mode, not HTTPS version of the remote URL.  
```zsh
➜  git remote add origin git@github.com:Akbarsait/mygitreponame.git
➜  git push -u origin main
```
If incase you set remote URL incorrectly, follow this command to update it. 
```zsh
➜  git remote set-url origin git@github.com:Akbarsait/mygitreponame.git
```

8. Create a Shell script "backup2git.sh" with the following git commands to handle adding and committing files to repository.     
```sh
# get the HA version and set ha version, current date and custom message. 
HA_VERSION=`cat .HA_VERSION`
COMMIT_DATE=$(date +'%d-%m-%Y %H:%M:%S')
COMMIT_MESSAGE="Autocommit from HA - [$HA_VERSION]: $COMMIT_DATE"

echo "$COMMIT_MESSAGE"

git add .
git commit -m "$COMMIT_MESSAGE"
git push
```

9. Provide executable access to the file and Check by manually running it. This manual execution is happening at the "Advanced SSH & Web Terminal" docker container not to the actual Home Assistant container. 
```sh
# setting execute permission to the file
➜ chmod +x backup2github.sh
# run the file to view results and correct any erros. 
➜ ./backup2github.sh
```

To validate how it runs on the Home Assistant container utilizes the following command. Further reading on how to handle Shell command through SSH. **[SSH’ing from a command line sensor or shell command](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/sshing-from-a-command-line-sensor-or-shell-command/258731)**

```sh
# run the following command
➜ docker exec -it homeassistant bash
# will display the prompt as follows 
homeassistant:/config# 
# now run the following command.
➜ ./backup2github.sh
```
The SSH terminal will display the following message. Type "yes" to add github.com as a known host. This will allow in executing the script through the automation.

10.  Include the following lines of code to the configuration.yaml file.  
```yaml
shell_command:
  run_gitbackup: bash ./backup2github.sh
```
11.  Create an Automation that runs on a specific time internal by calling the above shell script as a service.

The code of the automation viewed by checking in the 'Edit in YAML' option.

```yaml
alias: Daily HAConfig GitHub Backup
description: ""
trigger:
  - platform: time
    at: "15:00:00"
action:
  - service: shell_command.run_gitbackup
    data: {}

```
By following these steps, you can ensure that your Home Assistant configuration is regularly backed up to a private GitHub repository. This setup will provide peace of mind knowing that you can restore your configuration in the event of any failures.
